# video_in_place
WebRTC app built during a weekend long Twilio hackathon at the beginning of the pandemic. Original aim was to explore Twilio tools for video, while developing my own implementation for a secure WebRTC platfrom for work and personal communications. Stretch goal was integrating facial recognition software during a WebRTC feed. Current work: stripping away Twilio abstractions (_ran out of credits_), and rebuilding with browser native WebRTC features.
